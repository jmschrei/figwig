# Every input that `figwig bam2bw` accepts is built here from an explicit, tiny read
# layout rather than being committed as a binary fixture. The point is that the
# expected bigWig values in the test file can be derived by hand from the
# layout: a read that starts at 100 and is 50bp long contributes its 5' end at
# 100 and its 3' end at 149, and nothing in between. Committing a real BAM
# would make those numbers unauditable.


def write_chrom_sizes(path, chrom_sizes):

	Parameters
	----------
	path: str or pathlib.Path

	chrom_sizes: list of (str, int) tuples
		The chromosome names and their lengths, in the order they should
		appear. `figwig bam2bw` preserves this order in the bigWig header.

def write_fasta(path, chrom_sizes, line_width=60):
	"""Write a FASTA file whose sequences have the requested lengths.

	`figwig bam2bw` accepts a FASTA in place of a chrom_sizes file and reads the
	lengths out of it with pyfaidx, so only the lengths matter here. The
	sequence content is a repeating ACGT so that the file looks like real
	DNA to anything that inspects it.

	Note that pyfaidx writes a `.fai` index next to this file the first time
	it is opened, so the path should be inside a scratch directory.

	Parameters
	----------
	path: str or pathlib.Path
		The file to write to.

	chrom_sizes: list of (str, int) tuples
		The chromosome names and the length of the sequence to write for each.

	line_width: int, optional
		The number of bases per line of sequence. Default is 60.

	path: str or pathlib.Path
		The path that was written to, for convenience.

def write_bam(path, chrom_sizes, reads, unmapped=()):
	"""Write a BAM file containing the given reads.

	Each read is placed with an exact-match CIGAR so that its reference span
	is precisely `start` to `start + length`, which is what makes the expected
	5' and 3' positions hand-computable. The header can list more chromosomes
	than the chrom_sizes file passed to `figwig bam2bw` does, which is how the
	missing-chromosome filter gets exercised.

	Parameters
	----------
	path: str or pathlib.Path
		The file to write to.

	chrom_sizes: list of (str, int) tuples
		The chromosomes to put in the BAM header. Reads may only refer to
		chromosomes in this list.

	reads: list of tuples
		One tuple per read, giving the chromosome, the 0-based reference
		start, the length of the alignment, and whether the read is on the
		reverse strand. Two optional fields may follow: a CIGAR as a list of
		(operation, length) pairs, which replaces the exact match implied by
		the length and is how soft clips, splices and indels are built -- an
		empty CIGAR leaves the record's CIGAR as '*' -- and a
		SAM flag, which is how the duplicate, secondary, supplementary and
		QC-fail bits are set, and a mapping quality, which defaults to 60. The
		query sequence is sized from the CIGAR so that the record stays
		valid.

	unmapped: list of (str, int, int) tuples, optional
		One tuple per unmapped read to append, giving a chromosome, a start,
		and a length. The reads carry the unmapped flag but are still placed,
		the way a read whose mate aligned is placed next to its mate in a real
		BAM. Placing them matters for the tests: an unmapped read with no
		reference would be dropped by the missing-chromosome filter before the
		unmapped filter ever saw it, which would make the two filters
		impossible to tell apart. Default is an empty list.

	Returns
	-------
	path: str or pathlib.Path
		The path that was written to, for convenience.

	pairs: list of (str, tuple, tuple) tuples

		start, the length and whether it is on the reverse strand, optionally
		followed by extra flag bits to OR in -- 0x100 for secondary, 0x800 for
